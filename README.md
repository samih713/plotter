## Things to do
- [x] Refactor / clean up
- [x] Load CSV
- [ ] Add GUI
- [ ] Add build tool
- [ ] Publish as plotter (write `README.md`)
- [ ] Linear regression implementation

## Nice to have
- [ ] Default view: fit all data points within the plot area (inside the axes).
- [ ] Auto-scale axis ticks to “nice” steps (e.g., 1/2/5 × 10ⁿ) based on the data range.
- [ ] Toggle grid ,axis labels and coordinates
- [ ] Legend + basic styling (point size, line width)
- [ ] Show point tooltip on hover (x, y)
- [ ] improve performance
